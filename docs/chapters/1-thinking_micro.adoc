== Micro Thinking: from Monolith to Microservices


In the late 20th century and early 21st century developing monolithic applications were popular.
However, monolithic applications drawbacks hindered developers with maintaining and scaling application components.
Monolithic applications by nature tend to be highly coupled and grow in complicity as the application evolves.

According to wikipedia, Monolith definition goes as the following::
In software engineering, a monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application in which the user
interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform.
A monolithic application is self-contained, and independent from other computing applications.

The concept of microservices appeared at the Web Services Edge conference in 2005
by Dr. Peter Rodgers which stated that, "Software components are Micro-Web-Services".

According to wikipedia, Microservices definition goes as the following::
Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural
style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture,
services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different
smaller services is that it improves modularity.

Over the years microservices concept and tools evolved to meet requirements of large scaled applications.

=== Get Coding!

Its time write some code with Helidon libraries. First we will take a look at simple greeting service and then improve
the service.

The following dependency in the build.gradle must be declared.

[source, groovy]
----
    implementation 'io.helidon.webserver:helidon-webserver:1.0.0'
----


Now open the `chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code1.java`:

[source,java]
----
include::../../chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code1.java[]
----

<1> Required imports from Helidon library.
<2> Routing configuration with builder pattern.
<3> Specify the response to return a message.
<4> Build the Routing class.
<5> Start the server.



Run the code to start the server on localhost. This will start a *Netty* server exposing a random port.
The exposed port information will be written in the console when the server starts.

WARNING: In future examples we will configure the server to expose a designated port.

Run the following command in your terminal to get a 'Greetings' from the webserver.

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:[port]/greet
----

In this example we returned a simple 'Greetings!!!' message from the endpoint of
'/greet'.

Run this example and you should see::
[source, text]
----
Greetings!!!
----


=== Just Greetings?

Let move a step forward and try to make a specialized greetings messsage.

Parameters can be retrieved from url path like the following:

----
req.path().param("{param}")
----

Now open the `chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code2.java`:
[source,java]
----
include::../../chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code2.java[]
----

Fill in the designated code block to retrieve the name
from the requested path such as `*/greet/Kenobi*`and
return a greeting message.


Check `src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/chapter1/Code2_Solution.java`
for the solution of example.

[.assignment]
[source, java]
----
include::../../chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code2_Solution.java[]
----

<1> {`name`} indicates named path parameter.
<2> get the `name` from the path.
<3> send greetings message.

[source, bash]
curl http://localhost:[port]/greet/Kenobi

Should give an output of: `Greetings, Kenobi !!!`


=== Just Text?

Helidon libraries also support::
- JAX-RS
- JSON-P
- JSON-B
- Jackson

Follow dependency decleration in `build.gradle` enables helidon to retrieve/return JSONP data
[source, groovy]
implementation 'io.helidon.media.jsonp:helidon-media-jsonp-server:1.0.0'

Now open the `src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/chapter1/Code3.java`:
[source, java]
----
include::../../chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code3.java[]
----

<1> Add JSON support to routing class
<2> Create JSON object to be sent
<3> Send JSON data

[source, bash]
curl http://localhost:[port]/greet/Hulk

=== More Routing

HTTP `*GET*` operations is the most common used HTTP method
used to retrieve data from a server.

HTTP `*POST*` operations are used to send data to a server to update/create
a resource.

Here is a table for all HTTP routing methods that can be used in Helidon::

[cols="1,5,1"]
|===
|HTTP Method|Routing.Builder example|Example

|*GET*|`+.get((req, res) -> { /* handler */ })+`|  getInfo
|*PUT*| `+.put((req, res) -> { /* handler */ })+`| setConfig
|*POST*| `+.post((req, res) -> { /* handler */ })+`| registerUser
|*HEAD*| `+.head((req, res) -> { /* handler */ })+`| getMetadata
|*DELETE*| `+.delete((req, res) -> { /* handler */ })+`| deleteUser
|*TRACE*| `+.trace((req, res) -> { /* handler */ })+`| traceOperation
|*OPTIONS*| `+.options((req, res) -> { /* handler */ })+`| getRequirements
|_any method_|`+.any((req, res) -> { /* handler */ })+`| doForAll
|_multiple methods_|`+.anyOf(List.of(Http.Method.GET, Http.Method.POST), (req, res) -> { /* handler */ })+`| doForThese
|===

Helidon library provides a .any() method that will handle any HTTP request to the server.

Routing can be set to first log information about any http request and then forwarded to the next HTTP routing.

Now Open

Now open the `chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code4.java`:
[source, java]
----
include::../../chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code4.java[]
----

<1> Log information.
<2> Set response status
<3> send response with set response status

[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET -i http://localhost:[port]/
curl -X POST -i http://localhost:[port]/anything
----

In this example we are using .any() method to retrieve all HTTP requests.
Notice that both HTTP `*GET*` and `*POST*` request are logged in the console. In line <2>
we are setting the HTTP response header. Which can be seen in the `*curl*` requests stated
above.

=== Request Handling

Say that you are required to have two different HTTP methods but
have to make initial handlers for all http request. This routing can be done by `*ServerRequest*` objects
`*next()*` method.

Now open the `chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code5.java`:
[source, java]
----
include::../../chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code5.java[]
----

In this example we are routing every HTTP request to the initial handler of `*any*` and logging the desired information.
After the desired initial operation is complete we then route the HTTP request with `*req.next()*`.
The HTTP request is routed depending on the request to either `*foo*` handler or `*bar*` handler.


[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:[port]/foo
curl -X GET http://localhost:[port]/bar
----

*However, this server has a problem!!!*

Try HTTP `*GET*` on a different path
[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:[port]/zar
----

This returns nothing from the server.

Now open the `chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code6.java` and fill in the designated code block
to fix this problem.

TIP: Routing starts from start to bottom we have to route `*any*` other request to a handler.

Perform the previous `*curl*` operation to test the code.

////
TODO: Try to make a hidden block instead.
////
Check `chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code6_Solution.java` for the solution.

Perfect!! We now route `*any*` other request to a handler this way we always return a response for a request.


=== To Handle Or Not to Handle?

*That is the question* that all programmers must forfill.
Error handling is a must for a server, think of the possibilities.

Error handling can be set during the Routing class build phase. Such as

[source, java]
----
.error(MyException.class, (req, res, ex) -> {

                                res.send("I'll be back!");

                          }
       )
----

This way we can specify what operation must be carried out upon a designated _Exception_
is retrieved in a handler.

Now open the `chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code7.java`:
[source, java]
----
include::../../chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code7.java[]
----


This way we can handle a specific error thrown at any point.

[source, bash]
----
curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:[port]/foo

    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
    Date: Wed, 3 Apr 2019 16:07:24 +0300
    transfer-encoding: chunked
    connection: keep-alive


    There is no spoon!


curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:[port]/bar

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
    Date: Wed, 3 Apr 2019 16:08:00 +0300
    transfer-encoding: chunked
    connection: keep-alive

    Wrong argument!

----


However, what will happen if any other `*Exception*` either then
com.cemnura.helper.SpoonException, IllegalArgumentException occurred?
Helidon has our back!
Every unhandled error will return a default error with HTTP *500* ERROR that way
we will not reveal any server errors to the client.

----

curl -i -X GET http://localhost:[port]/zar

    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
    Date: Wed, 3 Apr 2019 23:20:48 +0300
    transfer-encoding: chunked
    con
    nection: keep-alive

----


=== Static Content

Helidon supports return static content such as files, images. In order to enable
netty server to return static content use `*StaticContentSupport*` class must be used.


Now open the `chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code8.java`:
[source, java]
----
include::../../chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code8.java[]
----

<1> register `*"/images"*` path to provide static content using `*StaticContentSupport.create()*`
<2> register `*"/images"*` path to provide static content using `*StaticContentSupport.builder()*`
<3> set welcome page to return `*index.html*` file
<4> set filename extensions that URL path will return.


=== Just do it!

Lets try to combine routing.

Now open the `chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/chapter1/Code9.java`:
[source, java]
----
include::../../chapter1/src/main/java/com/cemnura/lab/Code9.java[]
----

Notice How the code block where routing is empty. Its time to test our understanding.

.Please implement the following routing methods:
. .any((req, res) -> { /* handler */ })
. .any("/path", (req, res) -> { /* handler */ })
. .get("/path", (req, res) -> { /* handler */ })
. .get("/path1/{name}",(req, res) -> { /* handler */ })
. .get("/path2", (req, res) -> { /* handler */ req.next(); })
. .post("/path", (req, res) -> { /* handler */ })
. .post("/path", (req, res) -> { /* handler return JSON data */ })
. .register("/path", StaticContentSupport.create("/static"))
. .error(Exception.class, (req, res, ex) -> { /* handler */})
