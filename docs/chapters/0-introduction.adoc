== Introduction

In this lab, we are going to experiment creating microservices with *Helidon*.

Helidon developed by *Oracle* is open source and available under _Apache 2.0_ licence.

Helidon Repository::
https://github.com/oracle/helidon

Helidons symbol is inspired by a _swallow_ which is a swift songbird.
Helidon was designed to be simple and fast.
Helidon is just a collection of libraries running on *_Netty_* core.

Therefore, the developed microservice does not require any runtime environment such as tomcat, jboss

WebServer.create(
  Routing.builder()
    .get("/greet", (req, res)
       -> res.send("Hello World!"))
    .build())
  .start();
----

.Helidon  MP : MicroProfile

[source, java]
----
public class GreetService {
  @GET
  @Path("/greet")
  public String getMsg() {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
}
----
